Puppy-Restaurant

Description: We had to make an interactive multi site project based on the prototype called Puppy Restaurant. 

Peer Name: Kassandra Spacek
Peer Review: The design itself is close to the figma which is good. Unfortunately there are some issues with the text boxes going longer than they should and the content on the menu and about pages are wider then the viewport so you have to scroll to see the rest of it. I also recommend renaming the home.html to index.html and placing the pages in a separate pages folder. I did like how you did the photo page though. The subtle hover is a nice touch.
